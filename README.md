Summarization is the process of condensing a much larger body of text into an easy to consumable summary, while preserving the information concept delivered in the original document.. You can see the use of automatic summarization in many experiences delivered on the web. Examples include the summary provided in google searches, or the summary provided when posting a url in a chat application such as Slack.
Research has shown that more people will read the summary before they read an entire article.
